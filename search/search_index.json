You cannot find anything in your downloads and documents? Sorting and renaming all these files by hand is too tedious? Time to automate it once and benefit from it forever. organize is a command line, open-source alternative to apps like Hazel (macOS) or File Juggler (Windows). Features # Some highlights include: Safe moving, renaming, copying of files and folders with conflict resolution options Fast duplicate file detection Exif tags extraction Categorization via text extracted from PDF, DOCX and many more Supports remote file locations like FTP, WebDAV, S3 Buckets, SSH and many more Powerful template engine Inline python and shell commands as filters and actions for maximum flexibility Everything can be simulated before touching your files. Getting started # Installation # Python 3.6+ is needed. Install it via your package manager or from python.org . Installation is done via pip. Note that the package name is organize-tool : pip3 install -U organize-tool If you want the text extraction capabilities, install with textract like this: pip3 install -U \"organize-tool[textract]\" This command can also be used to update to the newest version. Now you can run organize --help to check if the installation was successful. Create your first rule # In your shell, run organize edit to edit the configuration: rules: - name: \"Find PDFs\" locations: - ~/Downloads subfolders: true filters: - extension: pdf actions: - echo: \"Found PDF!\" If you have problems editing the configuration you can run organize reveal to reveal the configuration folder in your file manager. You can then edit the config.yaml in your favourite editor. save your config file and run: organize run You will see a list of all .pdf files you have in your downloads folder (+ subfolders). For now we only show the text Found PDF! for each file, but this will change soon... (If it shows Nothing to do you simply don't have any pdfs in your downloads folder). Run organize edit again and add a move -action to your rule: actions: - echo: \"Found PDF!\" - move: ~/Documents/PDFs/ Now run organize sim to see what would happen without touching your files. You will see that your pdf-files would be moved over to your Documents/PDFs folder. Congratulations, you just automated your first task. You can now run organize run whenever you like and all your pdfs are a bit more organized. It's that easy. There is so much more. You want to rename / copy files, run custom shell- or python scripts, match names with regular expressions or use placeholder variables? organize has you covered. Have a look at the advanced usage example below! Example rules # Here are some examples of simple organization and cleanup rules. Modify to your needs! Move all invoices, orders or purchase documents into your documents folder: rules: - name: \"Sort my invoices and receipts\" locations: ~/Downloads subfolders: true filters: - extension: pdf - name: contains: - Invoice - Order - Purchase case_sensitive: false actions: - move: ~/Documents/Shopping/ Recursively delete all empty directories: rules: - name: \"Recursively delete all empty directories\" locations: - path: ~/Downloads subfolders: true filters: - empty actions: - delete You'll find many more examples in the full documentation .

Available filesystems max_depth setting when recursing into subfolders Respects your rule order - safer, less magic, less surprises. (v1 tried to be clever. v2 now works your config file from top to bottom) Jinja2 template engine for placeholders. Instant start. (does not need to gather all the files before starting) Filters can now be excluded. Filter modes: all , any and none . Nice terminal output. Rule names. new conflict resolution settings in move , copy and rename action: Options are skip , overwrite , trash , rename_new or rename_existing You can now define a custom rename_template . The python action can now be run in simulation. The shell action now returns stdout and errorcode. Added filter empty . Added filter hash . Added action symlink . Added action confirm . Many small fixes and improvements. changed # The timezone keyword for lastmodified and created was removed. The timezone is now the local timezone by default. The filesize filter was renamed to size and can now be used to get directory sizes as well. The filename filter was renamed to name and can now be used to get directory names as well. The size filter now returns multiple formats removed # Glob syntax is gone from folders (no longer needed) \"!\" folder exclude syntax is gone (no longer needed) v1.10.1 (2021-04-21) # Action macos_tags now supports colors and placeholders. Show full expanded path if folder is not found. v1.10.0 (2021-04-20) # Add filter mimetype Add action macos_tags Support simplematch syntax in lename -filter. Updated dependencies Because installing textract is quite hard on some platforms it is now an optional dendency. Install it with pip install organize-tool[textract] This version needs python 3.6 minimum. Some dependencies that were simply backports (thlib2, typing) are removed. Add timezones in created and last_modified filters (Thank you, @win0err!) v1.9.1 (2020-11-10) # Add {env} variable Add {now} variable v1.9 (2020-06-12) # Add filter Duplicate . v1.8.2 (2020-04-03) # Fix a bug in the filename filter config parsing algorithm with digits-only filenames. v1.8.1 (2020-03-28) # Flatten filter and action lists to allow enhanced config file configuration (Thanks to @rawdamedia!) Add support for multiline content filters (Thanks to @zor-el!) v1.8.0 (2020-03-04) # Added action Delete . Added filter FileContent . Python 3.4 is officially deprecated and no longer supported. --config-file command line option now supports ~ for user folder and expansion oenvironment variables Added years , months , weeks and seconds parameter to filter created and stmodified v1.7.0 (2019-11-26) # Added filter Exif to filter by image exif data. Placeholder variable properties are now case insensitve. v1.6.2 (2019-11-22) # Fix Rename action ( 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'items' ). Use type hints everywhere. v1.6.1 (2019-10-25) # Shows a warning for missing folders instead of raising an exception. v1.6 (2019-08-19) # Added filter: Python Added filter: FileSize The organize module can now be run directly: python3 -m organize Various code simplifications and speedups. Fixes an issue with globstring file exclusion. Remove clint dependency as it is no longer maintained. Added various integration tests The \"~~ SIMULATION ~~\"-banner now takes up the whole terminal width v1.5.3 (2019-08-01) # Filename filter now supports lists. v1.5.2 (2019-07-29) # Environment variables in folder pathes are now expanded (syntax $name or ${name} a additionally %name% on windows).

This filter compares files byte by byte and finds identical files with potentially different filenames. Parameters: detect_original_by ( str ) \u2013 Detection method to distinguish between original and duplicate. Possible values are: \"first_seen\" : Whatever file is visited first is the original. This depends on the order of your location entries. \"name\" : The first entry sorted by name is the original. \"created\" : The first entry sorted by creation date is the original. \"lastmodified\" : The first file sorted by date of last modification is the original. You can reverse the sorting method by prefixing a - . So with detect_original_by: \"-created\" the file with the older creation date is the original and the younger file is the duplicate. This works on all methods, for example \"-first_seen\" , \"-name\" , \"-created\" , \"-lastmodified\" .

Algorithms guaranteed to be available are shake_256 , sha3_256 , sha1 , sha3_224 , sha384 , sha512 , blake2b , blake2s , sha256 , sha224 , shake_128 , sha3_512 , sha3_384 and md5 . Depending on your python installation and installed libs there may be additional hash algorithms to chose from. To list the available algorithms on your installation run this in a python interpreter: >>> import hashlib >>> hashlib.algorithms_available {'shake_256', 'whirlpool', 'mdc2', 'blake2s', 'sha224', 'shake_128', 'sha3_512', 'sha3_224', 'sha384', 'md5', 'sha1', 'sha512_256', 'blake2b', 'sha256', 'sha512_224', 'ripemd160', 'sha3_384', 'md4', 'sm3', 'sha3_256', 'md5-sha1', 'sha512'} Returns: {hash} : The hash of the file. lastmodified # Matches files by last modified date Parameters: years ( int ) \u2013 specify number of years months ( int ) \u2013 specify number of months weeks ( float ) \u2013 specify number of weeks days ( float ) \u2013 specify number of days hours ( float ) \u2013 specify number of hours minutes ( float ) \u2013 specify number of minutes seconds ( float ) \u2013 specify number of seconds mode ( str ) \u2013 either 'older' or 'newer'. 'older' matches files / folders last modified before the given time, 'newer' matches files / folders last modified within the given time.

Examples: rules: - name: \"Show all files on your desktop last modified at least 10 days ago\" locations: \"~/Desktop\" filters: - lastmodified: days: 10 actions: - echo: \"Was modified at least 10 days ago\" Show all files on your desktop which were modified within the last 5 hours: rules: - locations: \"~/Desktop\" filters: - lastmodified: hours: 5 mode: newer actions: - echo: \"Was modified within the last 5 hours\" rules: - name: \"Sort pdfs by year of last modification\" locations: \"~/Documents\" filters: - extension: pdf - lastmodified actions: - move: \"~/Documents/PDF/{lastmodified.year}/\" mimetype # Filter by MIME type associated with the file extension. Supports a single string or list of MIME type strings as argument. The types don't need to be fully specified, for example \"audio\" matches everything from \"audio/midi\" to \"audio/quicktime\". You can see a list of known MIME types on your system by running this oneliner: python3 -c \"import mimetypes as m; print('\\n'.join(sorted(set(m.common_types.values()) | set(m.types_map.values()))))\" Parameters: *mimetypes ( list(str) or str ) \u2013 The MIME types to filter for. Returns: {mimetype} : The MIME type of the file. Examples: rules: - name: \"Show MIME types\" locations: \"~/Downloads\" filters: - mimetype actions: - echo: \"{mimetype}\" rules: - name: \"Filter by 'image' mimetype\" locations: \"~/Downloads\" filters: - mimetype: image actions: - echo: \"This file is an image: {mimetype}\" rules: - name: Filter by specific MIME type locations: \"~/Desktop\" filters: - mimetype: application/pdf actions: - echo: \"Found a PDF file\" rules: - name: Filter by multiple specific MIME types locations: \"~/Music\" filters: - mimetype: - application/pdf - audio/midi actions: - echo: \"Found Midi or PDF.\" name # Match files by filename Parameters: match ( str ) \u2013 A matching string in simplematch-syntax startswith ( str ) \u2013 The filename must begin with the given string contains ( str ) \u2013 The filename must contain the given string endswith ( str ) \u2013 The filename (without extension) must end with the given string case_sensitive ( bool ) \u2013 By default, the matching is case sensitive.

Parameters: code ( str ) \u2013 The python code to execute. The code must contain a return statement. Returns: If your code returns False or None the file is filtered out, otherwise the file is passed on to the next filters. {python} contains the returned value. If you return a dictionary (for example return {\"some_key\": some_value, \"nested\": {\"k\": 2}} ) it will be accessible via dot syntax in your actions: {python.some_key} , {python.nested.k} . Examples: rules: - name: A file name reverser. locations: ~/Documents filters: - extension - python: | return {\"reversed_name\": path.stem[::-1]} actions: - rename: \"{python.reversed_name}.{extension}\" A filter for odd student numbers. Assuming the folder ~/Students contains the files student-01.jpg , student-01.txt , student-02.txt and student-03.txt this rule will print \"Odd student numbers: student-01.txt\" and \"Odd student numbers: student-03.txt\" rules: - name: \"Filter odd student numbers\" locations: ~/Students/ filters: - python: | return int(path.stem.split('-')[1]) % 2 == 1 actions: - echo: \"Odd student numbers: {path.name}\" Advanced usecase. You can access data from previous filters in your python code. This can be used to match files and capturing names with a regular expression and then renaming the files with the output of your python script. rules: - name: \"Access placeholders in python filter\" locations: files filters: - extension: txt - regex: (?P<firstname>\\w+)-(?P<lastname>\\w+)\\..* - python: | emails = { \"Betts\": \"dbetts@mail.de\", \"Cornish\": \"acornish@google.com\", \"Bean\": \"dbean@aol.com\", \"Frey\": \"l-frey@frey.org\", } if regex.lastname in emails: # get emails from wherever return {\"mail\": emails[regex.lastname]} actions: - rename: \"{python.mail}.txt\" Result: Devonte-Betts.txt becomes dbetts@mail.de.txt Alaina-Cornish.txt becomes acornish@google.com.txt Dimitri-Bean.txt becomes dbean@aol.com.txt Lowri-Frey.txt becomes l-frey@frey.org.txt Someunknown-User.txt remains unchanged because the email is not found regex # Matches filenames with the given regular expression Parameters: expr ( str ) \u2013 The regular expression to be matched. Returns: Any named groups in your regular expression will be returned like this: {regex.groupname} : The text matched with the named group (?P<groupname>.*) Examples: Match an invoice with a regular expression: rules: - locations: \"~/Desktop\" filters: - regex: '^RG(\\d{12})-sig\\.pdf$' actions: - move: \"~/Documents/Invoices/1und1/\" Match and extract data from filenames with regex named groups: This is just like the previous example but we rename the invoice using the invoice number extracted via the regular expression and the named group the_number . rules: - locations: ~/Desktop filters: - regex: '^RG(?P<the_number>\\d{12})-sig\\.pdf$' actions: - move: ~/Documents/Invoices/1und1/{regex.the_number}.pdf size # Matches files and folders by size Parameters: *conditions ( list(str) or str ) \u2013 The size constraints. Accepts file size conditions, e.g: \">= 500 MB\" , \"< 20k\" , \">0\" , \"= 10 KiB\" . It is possible to define both lower and upper conditions like this: \">20k, < 1 TB\" , \">= 20 Mb, <25 Mb\" . The filter will match if all given conditions are satisfied. Accepts all units from KB to YB. If no unit is given, kilobytes are assumend. If binary prefix is given (KiB, GiB) the size is calculated using base 1024. Returns: {size.bytes} : (int) Size in bytes {size.traditional} : (str) Size with unit (powers of 1024, JDEC prefixes) {size.binary} : (str) Size with unit (powers of 1024, IEC prefixes) {size.decimal} : (str) Size with unit (powers of 1000, SI prefixes) Examples: Trash big downloads: rules: - locations: \"~/Downloads\" targets: files filters: - size: \"> 0.5 GB\" actions: - trash Move all JPEGS bigger > 1MB and <10 MB.
